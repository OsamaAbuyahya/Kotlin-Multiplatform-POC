# Kotlin Multiplatform POC

This project is a **Proof of Concept** for Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of Kotlin's cross-platform capabilities by sharing common code between Android, iOS, and other platforms.

## What You'll Learn

- **Kotlin Multiplatform Technology**: Learn how to build applications that share code between Android and iOS.
- **Build Android and iOS Apps with Shared Kotlin Logic**: Develop apps for both platforms with a single shared codebase.
- **Native App Performance**: Explore how Kotlin Multiplatform maintains native performance across platforms.
- **Use of Kotlin Multiplatform Libraries**: Utilize powerful libraries like Ktor for networking and SQLDelight for database access.
- **Build Apps with Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI**: Create modern UIs for Android using Jetpack Compose and iOS using SwiftUI.
- **Actual/Expect Mechanism Explained**: Understand the platform-specific implementation of shared code using Kotlin's `expect` and `actual` keywords.
- **Targets/Source Sets Explained**: Learn how to structure your project using targets and source sets for different platforms.
- **Shared Ktor Networking Library**: Implement network communication using the shared Ktor library in Kotlin Multiplatform.
- **Comparison Between Kotlin/Swift**: Compare the features and syntax of Kotlin and Swift to write effective cross-platform code.
- **SKIE by Touchlab**: Explore the integration of SKIE for optimizing Kotlin Multiplatform project efficiency.
